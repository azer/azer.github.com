   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;A person's identity is determined at birth&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a person is born, their identity is mostly unformed. The experiences in a person's life form their
values and views, the most important part of their identity. However, many cultural barriers, like &lt;a href='http://google.com/search?q=reace'&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;,
are determined at birth; these later impact the formation of their identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;foo = function()
{ 
  return 
  { 
    'foo':new Array(1,2,3) 
  } 
}

foo();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person's identity is mostly taught to them. This is demonstrated by the actions of True Son in The Light in
the Forest by Conrad Richter and of Thomas Black Bull in When the Legends Die by Hal Borland.
When both boys were forced out of living in the lifestyle of the Native Americans, they both held closest
to the values taught to them in their childhood. When True Son was forced out of his Native American family
and into his biological, white family, True Son hated being with the white people because he had been taught that they were his enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
