  <div class='PageContent'><p><img src="images/selfportrait.jpeg" alt="" />
I'm a self-employed software developer experienced in coding and designing web applications living in Turkiye.
Programming and especially dynamic languages like Javascript and Python is my passion. Besides my programming
fascination, I am highly interested at history, economics, camping and trekking.</p>

<p>Let's start from the begin of the story.</p>

<p>I was born in a small town named Kalamaki in south of the Anatolia, on June of 1987, as a son of two young teachers.
At my first 10 year in the world was not so much interesting, I was an ordinary kid loving playing Atari games
like Mortal Combat and similar legendary games.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>My introduction to programming started when I was in an IMF supported laboratuary middle-school by I wanted to learn HTML.
This learning process was one of my major reasons to continue high school in Computer Software department of an Anatolian
Technical High School. I took Basic Electronics, Algorithms and similar programming lessons by coding Pascal and Visual
Basic in this school. After the high school, I introduced to C, Delphi and C# in Computer Programming department of S.
Demirel University. At the same time, my HTML learning progress had been starting to include various topics like Linux,
Python and Web technologies. After 2 years break, now I'm studying Economics remotely at Anatolia University.</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>

<p>My first project was a javascript library named "Civciv" which means "chick" in Turkish. Still, it's possible to check out source codes of this library and a
multiplayer connect4 application developed by using Civciv in <a href="http://azer.googlecode.com">my googlecode page</a>. My second library experiment was better, it was using same name
with my open source, web development environment application named <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/rainbow-9">Rainbow9</a>. These projects are not active anymore,
but can be found at <a href="http://rainbow9.googlecode.com">the project page</a>. An another javascript library named Pi and a multiplayer chess application followed these first steps.
To get more details about my current projects, you may check out <a href="projects.html">My Projects</a> page.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>After I graduated Computer Programming, started to work as Javascript Coder for a company in Farnington named Pagos Inc. developing a web based spreadsheets
application. Once I was working this job, I met with the comet technology and released a simple library named pi.comet which was the major reason of that eBay Turkey hired me.
By working in eBay Turkey, I got a chance to focus on some open source projects, we released 1.2 version of the Firebug Lite with the Firebug Working Group. After a few months,
I left this job and started to work for a company named Parkyeri focused on mobile services to develop myself at Python and I designed and developed an e-commerce platform by using Pud Web Framework
which is one of my hobby projects.</p>

<p><strong>Currently,</strong> I work for just my personal projects and trying to improve my self in programming, various open source projects and some science topics like economics, history.
At my spare time, I like travelling to places I discover using Google Maps. Classic rock is my favourite music gender but I listen every kind of music except sound loops like
techno and car alerts :) You may check out my profiles in social websites listed below in this page to get more info about me. Also feel free to be participated in the projects I'm developing and contact
about any topics I'm interested.Thank you for reading.</p>
