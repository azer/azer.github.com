  <div class='PageContent'><p><img src="images/selfportrait.jpeg" alt="" />
I'm a self-employed software developer experienced in coding and designing web applications living in Turkiye.</p>

<p>Let's start from the begin of the story.</p>

<p>I was born in a small town named Kalamaki in south of the Anatolia, on June of 1987, as a son of two young teachers.
At my first 10 year in the world was not so much interesting, I was an ordinary kid who is addict of playing Atari games
like Mortal Combat and similar legendary games.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>My introduction to programming started when I was in a IMF supported laboratuary middle-school by I wanted to learn HTML.
This learning process was one of my major reasons to continue high school in Computer Software department of an Anatolian
Technical High School. I took Basic Electronics, Algorithms and similar programming lessons by coding Pascal and Visual
Basic in this school. After the high school, I introduced to C, Delphi and C# in Computer Programming department of S.
Demirel University. At the same time, my HTML learning process evolved among Linux, Python and Web technologies. After 2 years break,
now I'm studying remotely in Economics department of Anatolia University.</p>

<h3>Open Source</h3>

<p>My first project was a javascript library named "Civciv" which means "chick" in Turkish. Still, it's possible to check out source codes of this library and a
multiplayer connect4 application developed by using Civciv in <a href="http://azer.googlecode.com">my googlecode page</a>. My second library experiment was better, it was using same name
with my open source, web development environment application named <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/rainbow-9">Rainbow9</a>. These projects are not active anymore,
but can be found at <a href="http://rainbow9.googlecode.com">the project page</a>. An another javascript library named Pi and a multiplayer chess application followed these first steps.
To get more details about my current projects, you may check out <a href="projects.html">My Projects</a> page.</p>

<h3>Work</h3>

<p>After I graduated Computer Programming, started to work as Javascript Coder for a company in Farnington named Pagos Inc. which was developing a web based spreadsheets
application. Once I was working this job, I met with the comet technology and released a simple library named pi.comet which was the major reason of that eBay Turkey hired me.
By working in eBay Turkey, we released 1.2 version of the Firebug Lite with the Firebug Working Group. After a few months, I left this job and started to work for a company
focused on mobile services to develop myself at Python and I designed and developed an e-commerce platform by using Pud Web Framework which is one of my hobby projects.</p>

<p><strong>Currently,</strong> I work for just my personal projects and trying to improve my self in programming, linux and several science topics like economics, history. At my spare time,
I travel to places I discover using Google Maps. Classic rock is my favourite music gender but I listen every kind of music except sound loops like techno and car alerts :)
